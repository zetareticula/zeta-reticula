/// Compute roles for tokens in a prompt for LLM quantization in model-search scenarios
///
/// Tokens are represented as a vector of strings, and the role of each token is represented
/// as a vector of floats. The role of each token is computed as a probability distribution
/// over a set of roles.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `tokens` - A vector of strings representing the tokens in the prompt
///
/// # Returns
///
/// A tuple containing two vectors: one for the token strings and one for the role probabilities.
/// The role probabilities are represented as a vector of floats, where each element corresponds
/// to the probability of the token having a certain role.
