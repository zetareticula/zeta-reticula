# Zeta Reticula ðŸŒŒ

## A Vision of the Machine Age Unleashed

"Imagine a world where the vast machinery of the intellect, a Time Machine of thought, propels humanity into realms undreamed ofâ€”a future where artificial minds, vast and intricate, are sculpted with precision to serve the cosmos itself." â€” H.G. Wells, reimagined for the digital frontier.

Welcome to **Zeta Reticula**, a pioneering inference quantization platform that transcends the boundaries of conventional artificial intelligence. Born from the ethereal glow of the Zeta Reticula team (formerly EinsteinDB and MilevaDB), this project is a leap into the uncharted territories of machine learning optimization, where performance, scalability, and innovation converge in a symphony of code and computation.

## Project Overview

Zeta Reticula is an open-source, cutting-edge framework designed to revolutionize large language model (LLM) inference through advanced quantization techniques. Leveraging state-of-the-art algorithms and a distributed, federated architecture, we enable developers and enterprises to deploy trillion-parameter models with unprecedented efficiency. Our platform offers plug-and-play support for 4-bit, 8-bit, and 16-bit quantization, ensuring hardware and cloud-agnostic compatibility across diverse environmentsâ€”from edge devices to hyperscale data centers.

### Core Features

- **Quantization Excellence**: Optimize inference with precision-tuned 4, 8, and 16-bit quantization, reducing memory footprint by up to 60% while maintaining high accuracy.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Harness federated learning and distributed computing to support long-context scenarios (e.g., 1M tokens) and billion-scale datasets.
- **Hardware Agnosticism**: Seamlessly integrate with GPUs, CPUs, TPUs, and cloud infrastructures, eliminating vendor lock-in.
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Monitor latency (as low as 0.4 ms/sample), throughput, and ANNS recall via an intuitive, futuristic dashboard.
- **Privacy-First Design**: Employ differential privacy and homomorphic encryption to safeguard data in collaborative settings.

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Rust-based modules (`llm-rs`, `agentflow-rs`, `ns-router-rs`, `kvquant-rs`, `quantize-cli`) for high-performance inference and quantization.
- **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS, delivering a sleek, cosmic-themed UI/UX dashboard.
- **APIs**: RESTful endpoints with Actix-web for model management and metric retrieval.
- **Dependencies**: Chart.js for visualizations, Axios for API calls, and more, all orchestrated via Vite.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Node.js and npm (for front-end)
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)
- kubectl and Helm (for Kubernetes deployment)
- protobuf-compiler (for building protobuf files)

### Quick Start with Docker

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/zeta-reticula.git
   cd zeta-reticula
   ```

2. **Build and Run with Docker Compose**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This will build and start the salience-engine service. The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Kubernetes Deployment

1. **Build the Docker Image**

   ```bash
   docker build -t zeta-salience/salience-engine:local .
   ```

2. **Deploy to Kubernetes**

   ```bash
   # Create namespace
   kubectl create namespace zeta
   
   # Deploy with Helm
   helm upgrade --install zeta charts/zeta-reticula -n zeta --create-namespace -f charts/zeta-reticula/values-salience-only.yaml
   
   # Check deployment status
   kubectl -n zeta get pods
   ```

3. **Access the Service**

   ```bash
   # Port-forward to access the service locally
   kubectl -n zeta port-forward svc/salience-engine 8080:8080
   ```

   The service will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Local Development

1. **Build the Backend**

   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

2. **Run the API**

   ```bash
   cargo run --release --bin salience-engine
   ```

3. **Set Up the Front-End**

   ```bash
   cd app
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

### Troubleshooting

#### Docker Build Issues

- **Missing Dependencies**: Ensure all build dependencies are installed in the Dockerfile.
  ```dockerfile
  RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
      pkg-config \
      libssl-dev \
      build-essential \
      cmake \
      curl \
      git \
      clang \
      lld \
      protobuf-compiler \
      libprotobuf-dev \
      && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
  ```

- **Rust Version Mismatch**: Ensure the Rust version in the Dockerfile matches the required version for all dependencies.
  ```dockerfile
  FROM --platform=linux/amd64 rust:1.82-slim-bookworm AS builder
  ```

#### Kubernetes Issues

- **Image Pull Errors**: Ensure the image is available in your cluster. For local development, use `kind` to load the image:
  ```bash
  kind load docker-image zeta-salience/salience-engine:local --name your-cluster-name
  ```

- **Service Not Accessible**: Check if the service is running and the ports are correctly exposed:
  ```bash
  kubectl -n zeta get svc,pods
  kubectl -n zeta logs -l app=zeta-reticula,component=salience-engine
  ```

#### Common Build Errors

- **Protoc Not Found**: Ensure `protobuf-compiler` is installed:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install -y protobuf-compiler
  ```

- **Rust Toolchain Issues**: Ensure the correct Rust toolchain is installed:
  ```bash
  rustup update
  rustup default stable
  ```
